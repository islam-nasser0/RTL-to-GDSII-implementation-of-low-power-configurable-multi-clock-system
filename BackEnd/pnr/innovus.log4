**WARN: (IMPSYC-2):	Timing information is not defined for cell SYS_TOP; Check the timing library (.lib) file and make sure the timing information exists for the cell and you can run the checkTimingLibrary command to verify if the timing library has complete information after the design is loaded.
Type 'man IMPSYC-2' for more detail.
